  <h3 id=aboutmetitle> About Me </h3>
  <p> My name is Anna Micaela Cook and I am 16 years old. I originally am from Florida and moved to Virginia before my freshman year of high school. When I was enrolled in public high school I knew that I wasn’t reaching my full potential as a student and that something had to change if I wanted to become successful. When I heard about CodeRVA I was so excited about the thought of a fast-paced environment that would offer me an associates degree by the time I graduated high school that I knew this school was the place for me.

      I currently am both a student at CodeRVA and J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College and will graduate in 2020 with my advanced diploma and an associates in science with a minor in computer science.

  <h3 id=security> Security </h3>
    <p>While working in security my role was network incident response and security incident response. Our goal was to find a password management system for MAXXPower, write policy around the use of this system, and document the implementation process. Personally I helped create the policy for our system, Dashlane, and I also documented the implementation process.
      <h3 id=data> Data </h3>
      <p>During data I worked as both the policy administrator and the scrum master. We had two projects due so my team decided to divide and conquer our work. As scrum master I made the decision to try and complete our project as quickly as possible because we had to miss school due to snow days and many of our group members having to miss days due to christmas vacation. Our two goals were to find where visitors to our website were coming from and to implement a cloud-based analytic program. We were able to complete both of our goals with no issue and deliver a flawless presentation. </p>
      <h3 id=development> Development </h3>
      <p> In my final rotation I was the User interface user experience designer for MAXXPOWER’s website and it was my job to make sure that not only was the website functional but also aesthetically pleasing for the user. I worked closely with the head developer to ensure that our website was well rounded. </p>
